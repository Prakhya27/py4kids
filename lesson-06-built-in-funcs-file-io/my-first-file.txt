[01] The Zen of Python
[02] by Tim Peters
[03] 
[04] Beautiful is better than ugly.
[05] Explicit is better than implicit.
[06] Simple is better than complex.
[07] Complex is better than complicated.
[08] Flat is better than nested.
[09] Sparse is better than dense.
[10] Readability counts.
[11] Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
[12] Although practicality beats purity.
[13] Errors should never pass silently.
[14] Unless explicitly silenced.
[15] In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
[16] There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
[17] Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
[18] Now is better than never.
[19] Although never is often better than right now.
[20] If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
[21] If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
[22] Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
