He save the money on January 1st and he plans to withdrow \\$1000 on every December 31st in the next 5 years. In the 5th year, after he withdraw \\$1000 from his bank account, there should be no money left in the account. Write a program to calculate how much money Ben should deposit to his bank account at the very begining in order for Ben to do that. Rounded your result to the nearest dollars.\n",
